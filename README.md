###  about virtualenv and wrapper
If you do not want to install flask globally you can use virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper


>pip install virtualenv

>$ pip install virtualenvwrapper

>$ export WORKON_HOME=~/Envs

>$ source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh


#### Basic Usage of virtualenv

1,Create a virtual environment:

>$ mkvirtualenv my_project

This creates the my_project folder inside ~/Envs.

2,Work on a virtual environment:

>$ workon my_project

Alternatively, you can make a project, which creates the virtual environment, and also a project directory inside $PROJECT_HOME, which is cd -ed into when you workon myproject.

>$ mkproject myproject

virtualenvwrapper provides tab-completion on environment names. It really helps when you have a lot of environments and have trouble remembering their names.

workon also deactivates whatever environment you are currently in, so you can quickly switch between environments.

3,Deactivating is still the same:

>$ deactivate

4,To delete:

>$ rmvirtualenv venv

## API intereface

- Given a company, the API needs to return all their employees. Provide the appropriate solution if the company does not have any employees.

service address: http://127.0.0.1:5000/company/companyname

- Given 2 people, provide their information (Name, Age, Address, phone) and the list of their friends in common which have brown eyes and are still alive.

service address: http://127.0.0.1:5000/common

sample post json is samplerequest2.json

- Same as feature2 but only  send just the user id. and return the user names

service address: http://127.0.0.1:5000/commonid/id1/id2

only array of user name as result

- Given 1 people, provide a list of fruits and vegetables they like. This endpoint must respect this interface: { "username": "Ahi", "age":"30", "fruits":["banana", "apple"], "vegetables":["beetroot", "lettuce"]}

service address: http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/username

notice: the use name must use html encode, for example Decker Mckenzie should be Decker%20Mckenzie
